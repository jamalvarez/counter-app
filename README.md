### THIS IS THE COUNTER APP BY JESUS MARIN FOR CORNERSHOP'S TEST

First you must do `npm install`, and then you can just do `npm start` and this will make the app run in the port 3000.
It can be seen by other machines in the same LAN, if you want to test it using your phones or something.

### Comments

I struggled a bit with the collor palette, but I think I did a decent job on the composition of the UI.

I had to somewhat modify the server code as it wasn't really returning the entire list of counters whenever doing a request,
even though that's the way it said it was supposed to work; I hope I wasn't wrong lol.
